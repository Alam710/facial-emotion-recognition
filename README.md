# facial-emotion-recognition This study introduces a novel neural network architecture for facial emotion recognition that uses an improved depthwise separable convolutional network. This method effectively extracts deeper and more abstract features from images, while preventing the network from overfitting and improving its generalization ability. The method achieves high recognition rates on the IMED and CK+ datasets.
